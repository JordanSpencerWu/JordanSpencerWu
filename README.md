## üöÄ About Me

Hi my name is Jordan Wu. For my career I'm a full stack software engineer with many years of experience working in a fast-paced environment. I enjoy learning about software development and strive to get better each and every day. On my free time I enjoy listening to music, learning about sound design, music production, AI, Web3 and much more. I hope to one day be a founder of my own startup focused on building something people want in the future related to AI and Web3.
